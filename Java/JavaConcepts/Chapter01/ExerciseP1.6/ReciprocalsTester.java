/*
Chapter 1 - Exercise P1.6

Write a program that computes the sum of the reciprocals 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/10. This is harder than it sounds. Try writing the program and check the result. The program's result isn't likely to be correct. Then write the denominators as floating-point numbers, 1.0, 2.0, ..., 10.0, and run the program again.
